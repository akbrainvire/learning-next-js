Pre-rendering & Data Fetching Summary
Pre-rendering refers to the process of generating HTML in advance which results in better performance and SEO Next JS supports two forms of pre-rendering - Static Generation and Server-side Rendering
Static Generation
A method of pre-rendering where the HTML pages are generated at build time
Pages can be built once, cached by a CDN and served to clients almost instantly Example: Marketing or Blogging site
For a normal page, use getStatic Props function to fetch the data ahead of time
For a dynamic page, you also need the getStaticPaths function -----------------> we use getStaticPath which returns the object with keys as paths as an array of objects with key params that is also an object with id variable as key (that is file name) with value the values that we want to be pre-rendered and fallback key which can be true, false, "blocking".
fallback: false | true | 'blocking'
Pages cannot be updated without a full re-build
Incremental Static Regeneration

Server-side rendering(SSR)
Fetch data at request time
Personalize data based on user information in the incoming request
Example: News listing page
getServerSide Props function helps with SSR data fetching
Combining pre-rendering with client-side data fetching
Shallow routing - Routing without calling getStaticProps/getServerSide Props

ssr-> request
ssg-> build

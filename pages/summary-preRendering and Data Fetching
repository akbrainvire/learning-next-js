Pre-rendering & Data Fetching Summary
Pre-rendering refers to the process of generating HTML in advance which results in better performance and SEO Next JS supports two forms of pre-rendering - Static Generation and Server-side Rendering
Static Generation
A method of pre-rendering where the HTML pages are generated at build time
Pages can be built once, cached by a CDN and served to clients almost instantly Example: Marketing or Blogging site
For a normal page, use getStatic Props function to fetch the data ahead of time
For a dynamic page, you also need the getStaticPaths function
fallback: false | true | 'blocking'
Pages cannot be updated without a full re-build
Incremental Static Regeneration

Server-side rendering
Fetch data at request time
Personalize data based on user information in the incoming request
Example: News listing page
getServerSide Props function helps with SSR data fetching
Combining pre-rendering with client-side data fetching
Shallow routing - Routing without calling getStaticProps/getServerSide Props
